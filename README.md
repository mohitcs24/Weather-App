# Weather-App
Project Name: Weather App

Description:
The Weather App is a web application designed to provide real-time weather information based on user input. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases my proficiency in frontend web development and integration with third-party APIs.

Key Features Implemented:

User Interface: Designed a clean and intuitive user interface using HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling, ensuring a modern and responsive layout across different devices.
Weather Data Integration: Integrated with a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) using JavaScript fetch API to fetch and display weather data based on user-provided location.
Dynamic Content: Implemented dynamic content updates using JavaScript DOM manipulation, ensuring real-time display of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Geolocation: Incorporated geolocation API to automatically detect and display weather information for the user's current location, enhancing user convenience.
Error Handling: Implemented error handling and user feedback for invalid inputs or API request failures, providing a seamless user experience.
